1. http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-binary-tree-vertical-order/
Given a binary tree, print it vertically. The following example illustrates vertical order traversal.
           1
        /    \
       2      3
      / \    / \
     4   5  6   7
             \   \
              8   9 
The output of print this tree vertically will be:
4
2
1 5 6
3 8
7
9 



2. Given a Binary Tree, find vertical sum of the nodes that are in same vertical line. Print all sums through different vertical lines.
Examples:
      1
    /   \
  2      3
 / \    / \
4   5  6   7
The tree has 5 vertical lines
Vertical-Line-1 has only one node 4 => vertical sum is 4
Vertical-Line-2: has only one node 2=> vertical sum is 2
Vertical-Line-3: has three nodes: 1,5,6 => vertical sum is 1+5+6 = 12
Vertical-Line-4: has only one node 3 => vertical sum is 3
Vertical-Line-5: has only one node 7 => vertical sum is 7
So expected output is 4, 2, 12, 3 and 7



3. Given a sorted array of size n. Each element in array is unique and lies from 1 to n+1. Find the missing element. Write code and test cases for the same.



4.

10. 
Construct an array from its pair-sum array
A pair-sum array for an array is the array that contains sum of all pairs in ordered form. For example pair-sum array for arr[] = {6, 8, 3, 4} is {14, 9, 10, 11, 12, 7}.
In general, pair-sum array for arr[0..n-1] is {arr[0]+arr[1], arr[0]+arr[2], ……., arr[1]+arr[2], arr[1]+arr[3], ……., arr[2]+arr[3], arr[2]+arr[4], …., arr[n-2]+arr[n-1}.
“Given a pair-sum array, construct the original array.”
sum(pair-sum)/n-1 = sum(arr),    sum{the first n-1 pair sum} - sum(arr) 
**actually pair-sum[0] = arr[0] + arr[1], pair-sum[1] = arr[1] + arr[2], pair-sum[n-1] = arr[1] + arr[2]

1. Given an array of 0s and 1s, find the position of 0 to be replaced with 1 to get longest continuous sequence of 1s.
Eg: Array- 1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1
Output - index 9
Assuming array index starts from 0. 

2. Given an unsorted array, find the k smallest elements

k = 3
Output: 1, 4, 5 

3. Find the minimum distance between any 2 given nodes in a tree.

   2       3     ------->       9      13
  / \     / \                  / \     / \
 4  5    6  7                 0  0    0  0 
Always take care of all the corner cases

     /   \                        /   \
   2       3     ------->       2      5
  / \     / \                  / \     / \
 4  5    6  7                 4   9   15  22 
(I did it with Level Order Traversal) (Complete working code was required)



Convert a Binary Tree to Threaded binary tree


2- Given a row and column wise 2d sorted array.Find the kth element in this array.

Find the closest leaf in a Binary Tree
Given a Binary Tree and a key ‘k’, find distance of the closest leaf from ‘k’.
Examples:
              A
            /    \    
           B       C
                 /   \  
                E     F   
               /       \
              G         H
             / \       /
            I   J     K
Closest leaf to 'H' is 'K', so distance is 1 for 'H'
Closest leaf to 'C' is 'B', so distance is 2 for 'C'
Closest leaf to 'E' is either 'I' or 'J', so distance is 2 for 'E' 
Closest leaf to 'B' is 'B' itself, so distance is 0 for 'B' 




Check if a binary tree is subtree of another binary tree | Set 2
Given two binary trees, check if the first tree is subtree of the second one. A subtree of a tree T is a tree S consisting of a node in T and all of its descendants in T.
The subtree corresponding to the root node is the entire tree; the subtree corresponding to any other node is called a proper subtree.

[3,7] Conflicts with [1,5]
[2,6] Conflicts with [1,5]
[5,6] Conflicts with [3,7]
[4,100] Conflicts with [1,5]

You are given an array of positive integers. Convert it to a sorted array with minimum cost (minimum number of operations). Only valid operation are
1) Decrement -> cost = 1
2) Delete an element completely from the array -> cost = value of element

Given a Binary Tree and a number k, remove all nodes that lie only on root to leaf path(s) of length smaller than k. If a node X lies on multiple root-to-leaf paths and if any of the paths has path length >= k, then X is not deleted from Binary Tree. In other words a node is deleted if all paths going through it have lengths smaller than k.

}
Initially, all the nextRight pointers point to garbage values. Your function should set these pointers to point next right for each node. You can use only constant extra space.
